Policy first before buy or to do anything.



# What is a Cybersecurity Policy?

- A **cybersecurity policy** is a clear set of rules and expectations that tell you what you **can and cannot do** when using an organization's systems, data, and technology.
- It’s meant to **protect the organization and its people** by setting boundaries on behavior, access, and responsibilities.

# The Colors of Cybersecurity

- **White Team**: Management, Compliance, Analysis, Logistics (20%)
- **Yellow Team**: Software coders and architects (15%)
- **Orange Team**: Facilitates interaction and education (15%)
- **Red Team**: Offensive Security (15%)
- **Purple Team**: Integrates defensive tactics with offensive results (15%)
- **Blue Team**: Defensive Security (10%)
- **Green Team**: Enhances security automation with code and design (10%)






# What Is Governance, Risk, and Compliance?

- GRC management’s importance has been elevated in recent years as companies contend with increasingly intricate risks and regulations.
- **OCEG** (formerly the Open Compliance and Ethics Group) is credited with coining the GRC acronym in the early 2000s to synthesize a broad range of related activities.
- OCEG defines GRC as the **“integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.”**



# Why Is Governance, Risk, and Compliance Important for Companies?

- **Build efficiencies**: Standardized processes are easily repeatable. Individuals responsible for implementing GRC strategies know what is expected of them on a routine basis and can be more **productive and efficient** as a result.

- **Avoid duplication**: By developing a unified GRC strategy, leaders can be logical in assigning specific responsibilities. Departments are better equipped to **share resources and information**, and avoid wasted time duplicating tasks.

- **Cut costs**: An effective GRC strategy saves money on multiple fronts — through increased **operational efficiencies**, better allocation of resources, **eliminating duplicated efforts**, and **optimizing employees’ time**. Savings also come from proactively countering potential threats and avoiding/mitigating costly risks and regulatory fines.




#

# The Difference

## Governance (governing)
- Leads an organization by establishing what its goals are and what has to be achieved.
- Job of the governing body, e.g., board of directors/trustees or committee.
- Oversees management and the way they run the organization, not manage.

## Management (managing)
- Administers the day-to-day activities or operations of the organization to achieve the goals.
- Job of the management or executive team.
- Does its job in accordance with policy and resources.

#

# Effective Relationship

- Mutual respect for their separate but interdependent roles and responsibilities
- A clear definition of the results to be achieved
- Clearly defined and documented delegation and authority
- Mutual agreement about the boundaries of freedom granted to the chief executive to carry out his/her role and tasks
- A fair, ethical, and transparent process for evaluating the chief executive's performance


#




# Top Management Responsibility

A subset of enterprise governance that provides strategic direction, ensures organization objectives are achieved, manages risk and uses organizational resources responsibly and monitors the success or failure of the enterprise security program.

In order to establish successful information security governance, it requires:
- **Organizational Structure**
- **Assignment of roles and responsibilities**
- **Defined measurements of tasks**

#

# Security Management Structure

## Management to Operations Hierarchy

### Organizational
- **Security Policy**
- **Organizational Security**

### Technical
- **Asset Classification and Control**
- **Access Control**
- **Compliance**

### Physical
- **Personnel Security**
- **Physical & Environmental Security**

#

## Operations Level
- **System Development and Maintenance**
- **Communications and Operations Management**
- **Business Continuity Management**

#


## Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

- A senior-level executive
- Responsible for developing and implementing an information security program
- Procedures and policies designed to protect enterprise communications, systems, and assets from both internal and external threats
- Conducts employee security awareness training
- Develops secure business and communication practices
- Identifying security objectives and metrics
- Choosing and purchasing security products from vendors
- Ensures that the company/agency is in regulatory compliance

#


# Risk Formula

**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

### Breakdown:
1. **Likelihood**
   - Derived from:
     - **Threat** → **Exploits** → **Vulnerabilities**

2. **Impact**
   - Derived from:
     - **Causing** → **Business Impact**

3. **Result**
   - **Security Risk**

---

### Visual Structure:
- **Threat** → **Exploits** → **Vulnerabilities** → **Likelihood**
- **Likelihood × Impact = Risk**
- **Causing** → **Business Impact** → **Impact**
- **Impact** → **Security Risk**
