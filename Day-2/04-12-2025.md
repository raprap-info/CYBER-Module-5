Information Security Management
ISO:27001


Policy first before buy or to do anything.



# What is a Cybersecurity Policy?

- A **cybersecurity policy** is a clear set of rules and expectations that tell you what you **can and cannot do** when using an organization's systems, data, and technology.
- It’s meant to **protect the organization and its people** by setting boundaries on behavior, access, and responsibilities.

#

**Reference:** Cybersecurity Policies – Tips & Best Practices, 2024






#
CREATE A POWERPOINT TO PRESENT TO THE BOARD OR LEADER OF THE ORGANIZATION



#

# The Colors of Cybersecurity

- **White Team**: Management, Compliance, Analysis, Logistics (20%)
- **Yellow Team**: Software coders and architects (15%)
- **Orange Team**: Facilitates interaction and education (15%)
- **Red Team**: Offensive Security (15%)
- **Purple Team**: Integrates defensive tactics with offensive results (15%)
- **Blue Team**: Defensive Security (10%)
- **Green Team**: Enhances security automation with code and design (10%)






# What Is Governance, Risk, and Compliance?

- GRC management’s importance has been elevated in recent years as companies contend with increasingly intricate risks and regulations.
- **OCEG** (formerly the Open Compliance and Ethics Group) is credited with coining the GRC acronym in the early 2000s to synthesize a broad range of related activities.
- OCEG defines GRC as the **“integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.”**



# Why Is Governance, Risk, and Compliance Important for Companies?

- **Build efficiencies**: Standardized processes are easily repeatable. Individuals responsible for implementing GRC strategies know what is expected of them on a routine basis and can be more **productive and efficient** as a result.

- **Avoid duplication**: By developing a unified GRC strategy, leaders can be logical in assigning specific responsibilities. Departments are better equipped to **share resources and information**, and avoid wasted time duplicating tasks.

- **Cut costs**: An effective GRC strategy saves money on multiple fronts — through increased **operational efficiencies**, better allocation of resources, **eliminating duplicated efforts**, and **optimizing employees’ time**. Savings also come from proactively countering potential threats and avoiding/mitigating costly risks and regulatory fines.




#

# The Difference

## Governance (governing)
- Leads an organization by establishing what its goals are and what has to be achieved.
- Job of the governing body, e.g., board of directors/trustees or committee.
- Oversees management and the way they run the organization, not manage.

## Management (managing)
- Administers the day-to-day activities or operations of the organization to achieve the goals.
- Job of the management or executive team.
- Does its job in accordance with policy and resources.

#

# Effective Relationship

- Mutual respect for their separate but interdependent roles and responsibilities
- A clear definition of the results to be achieved
- Clearly defined and documented delegation and authority
- Mutual agreement about the boundaries of freedom granted to the chief executive to carry out his/her role and tasks
- A fair, ethical, and transparent process for evaluating the chief executive's performance


#




# Top Management Responsibility

A subset of enterprise governance that provides strategic direction, ensures organization objectives are achieved, manages risk and uses organizational resources responsibly and monitors the success or failure of the enterprise security program.

In order to establish successful information security governance, it requires:
- **Organizational Structure**
- **Assignment of roles and responsibilities**
- **Defined measurements of tasks**

#

# Security Management Structure

## Management to Operations Hierarchy

### Organizational
- **Security Policy**
- **Organizational Security**

### Technical
- **Asset Classification and Control**
- **Access Control**
- **Compliance**

### Physical
- **Personnel Security**
- **Physical & Environmental Security**

#

## Operations Level
- **System Development and Maintenance**
- **Communications and Operations Management**
- **Business Continuity Management**

#


## Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

- A senior-level executive
- Responsible for developing and implementing an information security program
- Procedures and policies designed to protect enterprise communications, systems, and assets from both internal and external threats
- Conducts employee security awareness training
- Develops secure business and communication practices
- Identifying security objectives and metrics
- Choosing and purchasing security products from vendors
- Ensures that the company/agency is in regulatory compliance

#


# Risk Formula

**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

### Breakdown:
1. **Likelihood**
   - Derived from:
     - **Threat** → **Exploits** → **Vulnerabilities**

2. **Impact**
   - Derived from:
     - **Causing** → **Business Impact**

3. **Result**
   - **Security Risk**

#

### Visual Structure:
- **Threat** → **Exploits** → **Vulnerabilities** → **Likelihood**
- **Likelihood × Impact = Risk**
- **Causing** → **Business Impact** → **Impact**
- **Impact** → **Security Risk**




#

# Factors for Risk to Exist

- Threat
- Vulnerability
- Probability or Frequency of Occurrence
- Impact
  - Monetary Loss or Expense
  - Reputational Loss
  - Physical (cause harm to personnel and bystanders)


#


# What is a Hazard?

- Often dictionaries combine it with the term "risk". For example, one dictionary defines hazard as **"a danger or risk"** which helps explain why many people use the terms interchangeably.

- The most common definition when talking about workplace health and safety is:
  - A **hazard** is any source of **potential damage, harm, or adverse health effects** on something or someone.
  - A hazard is the **potential for harm or an adverse effect** (for example, to people as health effects, to organizations as property or equipment losses, or to the environment).

- Sometimes the **resulting harm** is referred to as the **hazard instead** of the actual source of the hazard. For example, the disease tuberculosis (TB) might be called a "hazard" by some, but in general, the TB-causing bacteria (**Mycobacterium tuberculosis**) would be considered the "hazard" or **"hazardous biological agent"**.


#


# What is Hazard?

## Examples of Hazards and Their Effects

| Workplace Hazard | Example of Hazard               | Example of Harm Caused         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Thing             | Knife                          | Cut                             |
| Substance         | Benzene                        | Leukemia                        |

#



Hazard
 - Something that can potentially cause harm.
 - eg. pating ( okay lang )

 Risk
  - = hazard + exposure
  - eg. pating + lumapit ka sa pating




#


# What is a Risk Assessment?

- Risk assessment is the process where you:
  - Identify **hazards** and risk factors that have the **potential to cause harm** (hazard identification).
  - **Analyze and evaluate** the risk associated with that hazard (risk analysis, and risk evaluation).
  - Determine appropriate ways to **eliminate the hazard**, or **control the risk** when the hazard cannot be eliminated (risk control).

#

# Known Versus Unknown Risks

- Known risks are those which can be identified and analyzed beforehand in such a way as to be able to:
  a) Reduce the likelihood of their occurrence  
  b) Plan a risk response to reduce their impact in the event that they occur



#



# Types of Business Risk

- **Market Risk**: What happens when there is a substantial change in the particular marketplace in which a company competes.
- **Credit Risk**: When companies give their customers a line of credit; also, a company's risk of not having enough funds to pay its bills.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Refers to how easily a company can convert its assets into cash if it needs funds; it also refers to its daily cash flow.
- **Operational Risk**: Emerges as a result of a company's regular business activities and includes fraud, lawsuits, and personnel issues.




#

# Data and Information

# What is an Information Asset?

ISO 27001 defines an asset:
- **“Anything that has value to the organization.”** (ISO/IEC 27001:2005)
- Any **valuable location** within an organization's systems where **sensitive information** is stored, processed, or accessed.
- For example, an employee's computer, laptop, server, or company phone would be considered an asset. Likewise, sensitive information stored on those devices are assets.
- Because they are assets, they need to be managed and protected.


#

# Information Asset Register

- List at a high level of the "information" that you are wanting to protect.
- It is usually a list of critical information, personal information, and sensitive personal information.
- This includes also the hardware, software, and systems that you use to store, process, and manage them.
- In order to protect the asset, you need to also protect the container of the asset.
- It is best to identify the right information of your information assets. The information assets, including their location, owner, and value, are included in the register.


#

# Establishing Asset Types

- ISO 27001 suggests the following basic segregation of assets:
  - **Information assets**
  - **Supporting assets**:
    - Hardware
    - Software
    - People
    - Buildings
  - **Intangible assets** (e.g., brand and reputation)

# How to Successfully Implement GRC

3. **Research best practices and tools**  
A GRC strategy should be designed with best practices and optimal efficiencies in mind. The aim isn’t to add more work, but rather to streamline and improve current processes. Study lessons learned from other companies that have GRC strategies, gather input from a variety of stakeholders, and thoroughly research technology tools that will help individuals achieve better GRC management.

4. **Prioritize security, accuracy, and efficiencies**  
GRC strategies innately involve managing sensitive data and information from across the organization. Streamlining data is essential to breaking down silos and ensuring everyone is pulling from a single source of truth, but it must be done with proper security protocols and protections. Companies need the ability to limit who has access to specific data and information along the pipeline in order to manage their respective GRC responsibilities.


5. **Clearly define processes and accountability**  
As with any new initiative, affected individuals and departments need to have a clear picture of what is expected of them. Change is challenging enough — there is no room for ambiguity. Even the most well-designed strategy will fail if those responsible for enacting that strategy don’t fully understand the how and why of their roles. The GRC strategy should define specific GRC duties, objectives, and milestones for success, and include a thorough accountability map identifying who is culpable for oversight and/or execution of those duties.

6. **Take an incremental approach**  
A GRC strategy should be implemented in stages. This allows stakeholders to get different aspects of the strategy up and running, work out any initial kinks, and establish those new processes before moving on to subsequent stages. An iterative approach optimizes the chances for success and minimizes the potential for a domino-effect of problems that can occur with an expansive, simultaneous implementation.


7. **Communicate, communicate, communicate**  
Clear communication is vital to the long-term success of any GRC strategy. From the start, leaders should communicate the objectives and importance of the initiative to gain understanding and buy-in from stakeholders. They should communicate roles and responsibilities, investments, successes, and strategic milestones. To keep momentum going, they also should continuously communicate the value of the GRC strategy and GRC benefits, including savings realized, risks averted, and other outcomes achieved.

8. **Commit to continuous improvement**  
Executives and board directors should approach GRC as an ongoing effort. Measures should be built in to allow for routine reviews of existing processes and future needs relative to evolving markets, governance expectations, industry regulations, and compliance mandates. Individuals involved in managing GRC should have opportunities to provide feedback and suggest improvements based on their own experiences and successes in other companies. Senior leaders should commit to listening and providing the resources the company needs to effectively evolve its GRC strategy moving forward.

# Where we are now?

The National Cybersecurity Plan must be developed by DICT in accordance with RA 10844, hence, the National Cybersecurity Plan 2028 (NCSP 2028) draft is meant to serve as a guide for consultations, with the goal of using comments to improve the final version of the NCSP, which is scheduled to be released before the end of 2023.
