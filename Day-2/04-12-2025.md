# What is a Cybersecurity Policy?

- A **cybersecurity policy** is a clear set of rules and expectations that tell you what you **can and cannot do** when using an organization's systems, data, and technology.
- It’s meant to **protect the organization and its people** by setting boundaries on behavior, access, and responsibilities.

# What Is Governance, Risk, and Compliance?

- GRC management’s importance has been elevated in recent years as companies contend with increasingly intricate risks and regulations.
- **OCEG** (formerly the Open Compliance and Ethics Group) is credited with coining the GRC acronym in the early 2000s to synthesize a broad range of related activities.
- OCEG defines GRC as the **“integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.”**



# Why Is Governance, Risk, and Compliance Important for Companies?

- **Build efficiencies**: Standardized processes are easily repeatable. Individuals responsible for implementing GRC strategies know what is expected of them on a routine basis and can be more **productive and efficient** as a result.

- **Avoid duplication**: By developing a unified GRC strategy, leaders can be logical in assigning specific responsibilities. Departments are better equipped to **share resources and information**, and avoid wasted time duplicating tasks.

- **Cut costs**: An effective GRC strategy saves money on multiple fronts — through increased **operational efficiencies**, better allocation of resources, **eliminating duplicated efforts**, and **optimizing employees’ time**. Savings also come from proactively countering potential threats and avoiding/mitigating costly risks and regulatory fines.
