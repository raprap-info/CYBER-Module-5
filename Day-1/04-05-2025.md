A Cybersecurity Framework is a structured set of guidelines, best practices, and standards designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.

Here are the most commonly used cybersecurity frameworks:

# üîê 1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology

# 5 Core Functions:

Identify ‚Äì Understand your environment and assets.

Protect ‚Äì Implement safeguards.

Detect ‚Äì Discover cybersecurity events quickly.

Respond ‚Äì Take action after an incident.

Recover ‚Äì Restore operations and services.

# üõ°Ô∏è 2. ISO/IEC 27001
International standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)

Focuses on risk management and continuous improvement.

Requires documented processes and regular audits.

Ideal for organizations needing formal certification.

# üîê 3. CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security)
A prioritized set of 18 security controls

Practical and highly actionable.

Good for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs).

Covers basics like asset management, access control, vulnerability management, etc.

# üèõÔ∏è 4. COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)
Developed by ISACA

Focuses on governance and management of enterprise IT.

More high-level and strategic.

Good for organizations aligning cybersecurity with business goals.

# üß± 5. Zero Trust Framework
‚ÄúNever trust, always verify.‚Äù

Focuses on identity-based access control, least privilege, and continuous verification.

Not a traditional framework, but a powerful security model.

üß∞ Bonus: Other Specialized Frameworks
PCI-DSS ‚Äì For payment card security

HIPAA ‚Äì For healthcare data security (U.S.)

GDPR ‚Äì Data privacy for EU residents

MITRE ATT&CK ‚Äì Knowledge base of real-world attacker tactics and techniques

| **Risk**                     | **Likelihood** | **Impact**       | **Risk Level** | **Mitigation Plan**                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Breach                  | High           | Critical         | High           | Implement strong encryption, regular security audits.    |
| System Downtime              | Medium         | High             | Medium         | Maintain redundant systems and perform regular backups.  |
| Phishing Attacks             | High           | Medium           | High           | Conduct employee training and use email filtering tools. |
| Insider Threats              | Low            | High             | Medium         | Enforce strict access controls and monitor user activity.|
| Compliance Violations        | Medium         | High             | Medium         | Regularly review policies and ensure regulatory updates. |
| Malware Infection            | High           | High             | High           | Use antivirus software and update systems regularly.     |
| Third-Party Vendor Risks     | Medium         | Medium           | Medium         | Perform vendor risk assessments and monitor contracts.   |
| Natural Disasters            | Low            | Critical         | Medium         | Develop a disaster recovery plan and test it regularly.  |

**Legend:**
- **Likelihood:** Probability of the risk occurring (Low, Medium, High)
- **Impact:** Severity of the risk's consequences (Low, Medium, High)
- **Risk Level:** Overall risk level based on likelihood and impact
